    "# Getting started with Operate First\n",
    "If you are an open source developer interested in bringing your project to an Operate First environment, you have come to the right place. Below is important information and instructions on how to get started.\n",
    "## There are 3 parts to Operating First\n",
    "1. Operate First is a concept of bringing pre-release open source software to a production cloud environment.\n",
    "2. The Open Infrastructure Labs is the upstream where the cloud operators and project developers work in the open to Operate First.\n",
    "3. The Mass Open Cloud (MOC) is a production cloud resource where projects are run.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observing and interacting with the Ops team\n",
    "Projects are expected to work with the ops team in the open in github https://github.com/operate-first There is also work done to manage the infrastructure that can be found in the Open Infrastructure Labs project https://github.com/open-infrastructure-labs\n",
    "\n",
    "To see what’s happening right now, online chat is done at http://operatefirst.slack.com/. There is an associated mailing list hosted by the MOC: Operate-first-users https://mail.massopen.cloud/mailman/listinfo/operate-first-users\n",
    "\n",
    "Open Infrastructure Labs also has a mailing list: Openinfralabs http://lists.opendev.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openinfralabs You can view a dashboard in the OI Labs github to see an overview of what’s happening https://github.com/orgs/open-infrastructure-labs/projects/2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bring your project \n",
    "To get connected and investigate bringing your project to the MOC, you can join the general mailing list at https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/operate-first and introduce it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next step is bringing the discussion to the “Operate First Project Coordination meeting”, which is held on alternate Wednesday’s 8:30AM US Eastern time. (even numbered weeks for 2020) Meeting url: https://meet.google.com/kea-qtds-enp?authuser=0&hs=122. (email bburns@redhat.com for an invite).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another bi-weekly meeting an the alternate Wednesdays at 8:30 AM US Eastern time, called “MOC/ODH sprint planning” and it is primarily focused on the Ops team planning. (Odd numbered weeks for 2021) Meeting url: https://meet.google.com/oki-drge-wuc?authuser=0&hs=122\n",
    "\n",
    "More detailed information on onboarding to a cluster can be found here: https://www.operate-first.cloud/users/support/docs/onboarding_to_cluster.md\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few basic things that need to be understood about the Operate First environment at the MOC:\n",
    "-Operate First is an open source initiative. It’s about operating your project software in the open in a production cloud environment.\n",
    "-Operating at the MOC never implies that any feature or software will ship. Thus a new feature that is being considered can be tested without any implied commitment.\n",
    "-Open Infrastructure Labs is an open source upstream aimed at cloud providers and operators and that is where much of the operate first work is being done.\n",
    "-While a production cloud, the MOC is taking in pre-release software, and thus stability is not guaranteed, and should not be expected. No backup of user data is made. There is no SLA.\n",
    "-It’s free, but the cost is commitment. The MOC is not a place to bring a project and then leave. It’s expected that the developers will actively participate with the operators when needed and be available to help sort out issues.\n",
    "-The benefit to project developers is bringing back what’s learned to improve their project.\n",
    "-Also, projects need to agree that telemetry can be freely harvested from the cloud. It’s purpose is to help evolve open source cloud operations and it extends to building AI Ops tooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "(references:clusters)=\n",
    "## Operate First managed clusters\n",
    "The Operate First manages currently clusters within two environments  mass open cloud (MOC) and Hetzner\n",
    "### [MOC](https://massopen.cloud/) environment\n",
    "The Operate First initiative currently manages two clusters within the MOC environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`Zero` cluster](https://console-openshift-console.apps.zero.massopen.cloud/) for all user workloads\n",
    "- [`Infra`](https://console-openshift-console.apps.moc-infra.massopen.cloud/) cluster for cluster management, housing ACM and ArgoCD\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Operate First also deploys within EMEA region. Following clusters are deployed at Hetzner Cloud:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`Rick` cluster](https://console-openshift-console.apps.rick.emea.operate-first.cloud/) for experimental user workloads\n",
    "\n",
    "Please create an issue [here](https://github.com/operate-first/support/issues/new?assignees=first-operator&labels=kind%2Fonboarding%2Carea%2Fcluster&template=onboarding_to_cluster.yaml&title=NEW+PROJECT%3A+%3Cname%3E) if you would like to use a cluster. Note that unless you want to use ACM or operate ArgoCD, you are likely looking for access to the Zero cluster.\n",
    "Managed Services\n",
    "Operate First manages various applications and services in the environments listed above. These services are accessible to the general public, and their availability dashboards can be found here.\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Access to monitoring and dashboards (i.e. Prometheus and Grafana) is currently restricted, pending discussions on EULAs and data licensing. If you need to access these services in the meantime, please make an issue. We will do our best to accommodate your request.\n",
